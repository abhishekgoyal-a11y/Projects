With scams growing in scale and sophistication, the discussions underscored a shared urgency for:
🔹 Stronger public–private collaboration
🔹 Greater government‑to‑government interoperability
🔹 Coordinated cross‑border action
🔹 Better protection and capacity‑building for consumers and SMEs

Proud to see Wanjing Ji, Head of Ecosystem Risk at Visa Asia Pacific, contribute alongside leaders from PayPal, Standard Chartered, IMDA Singapore, PIPC Korea, Access Partnership, Meta, and the Global Anti‑Scam Alliance.

The workshop highlighted APEC’s strength as a platform for practical, consensus‑based solutions, bringing together public‑ and private‑sector perspectives—including through engagement with the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC).

Visa remains committed to working closely with APEC economies, ABAC, industry partners, and the broader ecosystem to strengthen digital trust, enhance scam resilience, and protect consumers and businesses across Asia Pacific.",23

5,2d,"In the second edition of In Conversation, Kunal Chatterjee, Head of Acceptance Sales for VAS at Visa Asia Pacific spoke with Sisca Margaretta Elliott about what he believes has changed dramatically about payments in the last few years: how people pay, and in turn, how merchants accept payments. 

The way people transact today is diverse and omnichannel: with a tap of their cards, mobile phones, and wearables like smartwatches. Currencies are also evolving with digital currencies, gaming credits, and more becoming part of the fabric of digital transactions.

How can merchants accept new forms of payments regardless of methods, form factors, and borders in a fast, secure, and reliable way? 

This is what matters to Visa. In particular, the Visa Acceptance Platform enables merchants across Asia Pacific to accept digital payments from all major card networks, be it tapping or swiping in person or even virtually in card-not-present scenarios with a single API integration. 

Along with Visa’s 99.999% network uptime and Visa-grade security trusted by millions worldwide, merchants can enjoy best-in-class digital acceptance with peace of mind – today and tomorrow.

From community learning spaces in India to financial education in Hong Kong and a financial literacy program for women in Fiji, Visa is advancing inclusive growth by equipping people with the skills they need to thrive in a digital economy.

In India, our partnership with Read India has expanded four Community Library and Resource Centres across Karnataka, supporting 1,950 women and youths with education, digital literacy and job-ready skills since 2024 - helping women build livelihoods and children develop confidence to learn and lead.

In Hong Kong, Visa supports the Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship, an 11-year partnership with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and Hong Kong Education Bureau. The largest student competition of its kind in the Greater Bay Area, the programme has reached 92% of Hong Kong’s secondary schools. Its latest edition engaged 19,800 students from over 300 schools, combining financial knowledge, fintech innovation, and mentorship to prepare young people for a rapidly evolving digital economy.

In Fiji, Visa partnered with Good Return to deliver the Consumer Awareness and Financial Empowerment (CAFE) program in Serua Province — a multi-week learning journey in financial capability and behavioural change for women in the underserved communities. Delivered by 21 trained coaches and reaching over 190 participants, the program drove measurable impact, including increased trust in mobile financial services, stronger money-management behaviours, and a sharp reduction in financial stress.

At Visa, we believe education is a powerful driver of inclusive growth. When learning is accessible, people prosper and economies move forward. That’s why we’re committed to expanding opportunities so everyone, everywhere can learn, grow, and thrive.

10,3w,"2025 was transformative for payments in Asia Pacific. At its heart was a convergence of new technologies, especially AI and Web3 that is reshaping commerce, trade, and money. 

If 2025 was fast, 2026 will be at warp speed. Advancing digital infrastructure, a maturing regulatory landscape, and widening access to cutting-edge capabilities will make Asia Pacific the epicentre of innovation. 

Here are 5 key shifts shaping the future: 

🤖 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐛𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦, 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐛𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐬: AI-powered shopping and payments go mainstream, for consumers and enterprises. More agentic experiences will surface in the market, catering not just to consumers but also the 200 million companies in Asia Pacific, many led by a new generation of leaders looking for frictionless and secure business payments. 

💱 𝐍𝐨𝐭 𝐟𝐢𝐚𝐭 𝐨𝐫 𝐜𝐫𝐲𝐩𝐭𝐨, 𝐛𝐮𝐭 𝐟𝐢𝐚𝐭 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐜𝐫𝐲𝐩𝐭𝐨: The debate between traditional currencies and digital assets is coming to an end. As stablecoins become increasingly integrated into the economy, growing regulatory clarity in Asia Pacific will accelerate their use and integration in commerce and business. 

🔐 𝐈𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲, 𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐀𝐈: The growth of AI and agentic commerce will make secure and trusted authentication a strategic differentiator. As more AI agents transact on our behalf, governments, businesses, and networks must come together to combat AI-driven identity fraud. 
 
🛒 𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝𝐛𝐲𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐨𝐧𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐮𝐚𝐥 𝐠𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐜𝐤𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐬: Typing in card numbers and codes at checkout will become a relic, as consumers seek faster and more reliable eCommerce experiences. In their place will be tokenised credentials and biometric authentication, such as Visa Payment Passkey that enable faster and safer shopping. 

🌏 𝐀 𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐰𝐞𝐝 𝐟𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐩𝐚𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬: The intersection of cash, cards, wallets, and now digital currencies will be a defining theme of 2026. More governments and businesses will strive to connect the dots in a digital-first, mobile-centric, and AI-powered Asia Pacific.

With emerging technologies transforming how people transact, the risks are evolving just as quickly. Protecting consumers, businesses, and the broader payments ecosystem requires constant vigilance, cross‑sector partnership, and a shared commitment to staying ahead of increasingly sophisticated threats. 

Against this backdrop, Visa was honored to join the US-ASEAN Business Council on the high‑level workshop, “Strengthening Indonesia’s Digital Future: Advancing Cybersecurity in the Age of Emerging Technologies.” The discussion underscored the importance of collective action to ensure security, resilience, and trust as digital adoption accelerates nationwide. 

We were privileged to contribute through remarks by Mr. Abdul Rahim, Southeast Asia, Head of Risk at Visa, who highlighted the rise of AI‑driven cyber threats and outlined strategies to strengthen digital payment security across Indonesia. We also welcomed keynote insights from Mr. Albert Rachmad Wibowo, Deputy Head of Badan Siber dan Sandi Negara; Ambassador Peter M. Haymond, Chargé d’Affaires ad interim, U.S. Embassy Jakarta; and Ms. Lilian Rogers, Head of Government Affairs ASEAN at Cisco, who emphasized unlocking ASEAN’s digital future through cybersecurity, AI, infrastructure, and Quantum Computing. 

At Visa, we remain deeply committed to working hand‑in‑hand with policymakers, regulators, financial institutions, and industry partners. We recognize that safeguarding Indonesia’s digital ecosystem is a shared responsibility, and we are grateful for the trust and collaboration that make this work possible. By strengthening partnerships and openly sharing threat intelligence, we aim to contribute to a more secure digital environment, one that protects users and supports Indonesia’s ongoing innovation and economic growth. 

Our sincere thanks to the US‑ASEAN Business Council, all speakers, and every participant for contributing to this meaningful dialogue. We look forward to deepening our partnerships to advance a safer and more inclusive digital future.
